    "# Intelligent Multi-Agent Study System\n",
    "### Capstone Project: KAGGLE 5-Day Intensive AI Agents Course By GOOGLE.\n",
    "*Author:* Leelakrishna Rajasimha Yadav Doddakula\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project implements a multi-agent system designed to act as a personal study assistant. The goal was to build a system where multiple specialized agents cooperate to teach a subject, rather than using a single script.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to implement this using an event-driven architecture because it allows the agents (Retriever, Explainer, Planner) to work independently without blocking the main program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Architecture\n",
    "The system uses Python's threading and queue modules to handle asynchronous communication between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Workflow\n",
    "1.  *Retriever Agent:* Searches the in-memory vector store for relevant text chunks based on the user's query.\n",
    "2.  *Explainer Agent:* Takes the retrieved context and generates a summarized explanation.\n",
    "3.  *Planner Agent:* Creates a study schedule based on the requested topic.\n",
    "4.  *QuizBot Agent:* Generates questions to test the user's understanding and calculates a score.\n",

    "## Requirements Implemented\n",
    "This project covers 5 key concepts from the course curriculum:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Multi-agent System*\n",
    "I used a sequential pipeline where the output of the Retriever becomes the input for the Explainer. The agents run on separate threads to simulate a real-world application.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Sessions & Memory*\n",
    "The system includes a MemoryBank class. This allows the agents to store conversation history and recall it later using a basic keyword search with recency bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Context Engineering (RAG)*\n",
    "Instead of sending raw queries to the LLM, the system retrieves relevant data from SimpleVectorStore first to provide context for the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Observability & Logging*\n",
    "I implemented structured logging using Python's logging library. This allows tracking of every message sent between agents for debugging and performance monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Tools*\n",
    "The agents rely on specific internal tools to function, such as the mock_llm_call (simulating an AI API) and the mock_embed (simulating vector embeddings).\n",
    "\n",

    "## How to Run\n",
    "Click *\"Run All\"* to execute the notebook. The script will:\n",
    "1.  Initialize the agent system.\n",
    "2.  Ingest the sample Calculus knowledge base.\n",
    "3.  Run a simulation where the agents explain \"Definite Integrals\" and create a study plan.\n",
    "4.  Generate a performance graph at the end."
